collectstatic command
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
python manage.py collectstatic 

whenever we run this command django looks for all the static files
in the static folder when we run this command it gather all the files into static
when we run this command
STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'static' command django copies all the files into root here in our case
MULTIVENDOR RESTAURANT is static root 

These collected files will served in the production server after we have developed if we don't run this
command in production static files are not loaded

note: This command should only be used for production websites


Storing the sensitive information like passwords of the database
===================================================================================
To solve this problem we have package in python called python decouple 


from decouple import config in settings.py

create .env file in root directory

In settings we have SECRET_KEY we need to keep this safe just copy the whole key and put in .env file
the .env file takes data in key-value pair

Now in settings 
write this code

SECRET_KEY = config('SECRET_KEY')

#In case if you want other users to configure their projects in their system create file called
.env-sample
-----------
Include only keys not values so others can setup the configuration

git status
---------------------------------------------------------------------
git status command helps us to know the what work we done until now
